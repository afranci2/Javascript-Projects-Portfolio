        Who is Anthony?
    </h1>
    <p1>
        Hello, my name is Anthony Francisco. 
        I am from Providence, RI. I graduated from Classical High School.
         I hope to become a business owner in the future. 
         I tried to start my own businesses throughout high school with 
         physical products, but I realized success comes from selling 
         software as a product or service. I am also a musician and know 
         how to play several instruments with excellence. I commute to most 
         of my classes and volunteer at several non-profit organizations.
